# Predicting NFL Games

I scraped NFL Performance Data and Weather Data to predict whether or not NFL team will cover against the spread

I used both a gradient boosted regression, and a random forest classifier to model the team's performance

The training data is available in this folder under 'nfl_training_data.csv'. 

Feel free to reach out with any suggestions to improve my model, or other inputs I should consider
