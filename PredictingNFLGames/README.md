# Predicting NFL Games

Using a logistic regression model, I predict the outcome of a game based on the team's performance over the last 5 games.

More specifically, I predict the outcomes of NFL games based on variables such as Offensive Passing Yards and Defensive Turnovers.

I train the model using last season's performance, then feed the model the performance over the course of this season to predict the outcome for each game

The data comes from Pro Football Focus
