# Projects

- 👋 Welcome to my github repo
- 👨🏾‍💻 In this repo, you will find different data science projects that I work on in my spare time to supplement my learning of DS topics/packages/techniques
- 💡 This means a lot of what you see are works in progress, but rather me putting ideas into action
- 📧 If you see anything interesting, or want to collaborate, reach me here: dfasil510[at]gmail.com
