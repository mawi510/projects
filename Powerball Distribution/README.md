# Powerball Distribution

I wanted to see if the powerball lottery was a fair lottery, or otherwise take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity that may exist

I scraped powerball numbers from https://www.texaslottery.com/export/sites/lottery/Games/Powerball/Winning_Numbers/index.html_2013354932.html

Ultimately, the powerball is indeed fair. A QQ plot is available here as 'powerball_qqplot_image'
